    "-  A _systematic review_ extracts and interprets data from published studies on the topic (in the scientific literature), then analyzes, describes, critically appraises and summarizes interpretations into a refined evidence-based conclusion (source: Wikipedia)\n",
    "-  _Topic Modeling_ is an approach to text mining (= data mining of texts) based on unsupervised machine learning, which helps to determine hidden topics within a vast body of unstructured text. \n",
    "-  Due to the large amount of published work in many areas, traditional literature review becomes impractical, inefficient, time-consuming, and potentially less reliable. Yet, it is important to take stock of which topics have been core to the research and whether specific time trends can be identified in these topics. \n",
